Unfortunately I did not reach all the way in time 
The model provided is good enough to predict all 20 test samples correct (or 19/20 and one as the second best guess)
The work is far from finished and the commit was 15 min past deadline.

Unfortunately the last modifications made things BAD so don't run the last loop that prints out results (prints out way to much)
the in sample prediction  is between 95 and 98 % for the models 
(can easily be tweaked better but with risk of worse out of sample prediction)
